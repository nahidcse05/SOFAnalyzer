<p>I dont think you have this file <code>/var/www/svn/repos/db/txn-current-lock</code> on your machine. Have you checked whether it <code>exists on your system or not</code>. How can you give permission on files which does not belong to your system.</p>

<p>It might be issue which <code>server admin should take care of</code>.He should give proper permission to files.Ask them.</p>
