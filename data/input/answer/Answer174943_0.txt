<p>This have been reported as bug in Ubuntu 13.10 :</p>

<p>It affected only 2 people, therefore the fix never maked it into production version. I am suspicious that it was never fixed afterwards, so it is still in 14.04.2.</p>

<p>I think, you can dowload the fix for yourself and compile your own version of libgtop2 if you mind.</p>
