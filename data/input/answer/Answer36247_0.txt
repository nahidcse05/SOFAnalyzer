<p>Since no one had an answer, I went ahead and tried it out.  I was warned that moving and Resizing my boot partition my result in problems, but forged ahead anyway.  I deleted the /dev/sda5 partition and resized both my Fedora and Ubuntu partitions, all using GParted on my Ubuntu 12.04 LiveCD, and everything went fine.  I just figured I would close this out just in case anyone else has the same question I did.</p>
