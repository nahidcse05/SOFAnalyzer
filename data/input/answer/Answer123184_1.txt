<p>I have the same problem with my Thinkpad running the same AMD A8-4500m on Ubuntu 13.10.
I found this today, but my english isn't that good,so I didn't understand it.</p>

<p>May it be helpful for you.</p>

<p>The main commence I found is, that the Turbo Core isn't supported since 11.10.
That's all I found. Please prove me that I'm wrong.</p>
