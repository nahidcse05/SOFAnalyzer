<p>Do you mean how do you return to a "prompt" after opening a GUI from command line? If so then:</p>

<p>Usually when you close the GUI window you'll return to a prompt, if not you can force it to close by pressing ctrl + c from the command line window.</p>

<p>If you want to run the GUI application but continue to use the command prompt you can run the command to launch the GUI application with an '&amp;' after it, for example:</p>

<pre><code>gedit test.txt &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>Which will run it in the background.</p>
