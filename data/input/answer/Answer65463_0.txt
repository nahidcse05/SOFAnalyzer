<p>I found a similar problem with install in Oracle VirtualBox after configuring boot and swap partition as well. I also installed metacity, kernal headers (Ubuntu 12.10), manually downloaded VB additions, etc. Then I found to kill process with gnome-session provided a GUI login screen. Then I select Classic Gnome. To get the panel again I also had to kill process with gnome-panel - also from Ctrl-Alt-Fx (x from 1 to 6) as root. Maybe this helps somebody a bit further along. (836 GB RAM, 128 MB Video ram, 8GB hdd dynamic). (No problem on vmplayer 5.1 - I hope) Server is Windows 7 on HP Probook.</p>
