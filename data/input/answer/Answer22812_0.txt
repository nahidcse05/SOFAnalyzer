<p>You should try to avoid using, for example, KDE apps loading kde-modules (try, i mean; there's nothing wrong with them but the point of keeping the system light) There's nothing wrong with using Qt apps; for example, comparing Amarok and Clementine, they are similar apps but Amarok is based around KDE while Clementine is just plain Qt; and so on with Gnome apps, although as they are Gtk apps usually you will have less dependencies and libraies to load if you are in Xfce or Lxde.</p>
