  <p>How can i prevent reset byte count in /proc/net/dev</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can not: the size of the variables for the counter only allow a value up to 4GB. </p>

<p>It is the program you use that should already be aware of this and should take care of this: it should poll twice and if the 2nd value is less than the 1st value add 4Gb to the 1st value. Subtracting the two will then show the correct result. </p>

<p>If it does not you should file a bug report against that software. </p>
