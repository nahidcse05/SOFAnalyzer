<p>Because you probably have different client and server version packages installed.  First, I'd check what packages you have installed:</p>

<pre><code>dpkg -l | grep postgresql
</code></pre>

<p>Then install the 9.3 server package if you don't already have it.</p>

<p>If you already have it, check what clusters you have running:</p>

<pre><code>pg_lsclusters
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't already have a 9.3 cluster, make one (<code>pg_createcluster</code>).  If you do, note the port number and make sure you connect to that one.</p>
