<p>The following worked for me.</p>

<p>There's an option in <code>/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf</code> 
called <code>AutoConnect=true</code>. Make sure this is <strong>not</strong> commented (i.e. no hashes)
(change <code>#AutoConnect=true</code> to <code>AutoConnect=true</code>)</p>

<p>This will make pulseaudio recognize the device.</p>
