<p>You need to remove the battery and flip a little switch behind the battery and then it would be in CD-ROM Discovery mode.</p>

<p>You can then access the root and reset the password after you pass the cd-rom stuff. (Pass through with NO, NO and then CONTINUE.</p>

<p>If i recall correctly, you then select the second last item on the menu and you would be able to mount 'mmcblk0p3' from there.</p>

<p>Good Luck, hope this helps...</p>
