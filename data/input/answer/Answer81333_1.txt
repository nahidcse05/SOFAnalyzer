<p>No, you can safely delete the folders. However, folders with a lock on them can't be deleted by moving to trash.</p>

<p>Fire up a terminal, and enter the following to become root:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nautilus
</code></pre>

<p>and then repeat your search and delete the thunderbird files.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Prior to 13.04 , try <code>gksu</code> instead of <code>sudo</code>.</p>
