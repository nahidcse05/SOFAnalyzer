<p>As you can see in <a href="http://askubuntu.com/a/446056/16395">other answers</a>, the title of the tab is changed by the shell every time it outputs a prompt. And after executing <code>top</code> your tab exits because the command you told it to run finishes...</p>

<p>I'll do the following:</p>

<p>Step 1: call the terminal with shells, adding environment variables like that: </p>

<pre><code>gnome-terminal --tab -t X -e "env MYTAB=X bash" --tab -t Y -e "env MYTAB=Y bash" 
</code></pre>

<p>Step 2: add at the end of your <code>.bashrc</code> the following code:</p>

<pre><code>#if MYTAB is not set, return
[ -z "$MYTAB" ] &amp;&amp; return
# reset the cursor and title 
PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
PS1="\[\e]0;$MYTAB \w\a\]$PS1"   #title: $MYTAB and current dir
# execute the commands for every tab
case "$MYTAB" in
        X)
                echo this is X
        ;;

        Y)
                echo this is Y 
                top
        ;;
esac
</code></pre>

<p>...which I think is easy to understand and you can modify with the command/tweaks you need. Tested and works ok; after you exit <code>top</code> from the tab you'll still have the prompt and the tab for you to peruse. </p>
