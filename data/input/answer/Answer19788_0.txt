<p>dhclient was converted to an upstart job, which is just another way of managing services, a number of things were converted to that in Natty and Oneiric.  If you run sudo service dhclient start you're going to see the message "RTNETLINK answers: File exists" that appears to be the actual problem you're having.  The init script is actually running the upstart job for you, but there's a problem with starting dhclient.  From a quick Google, it looks like you may have a problem in your network interface configuration.</p>
