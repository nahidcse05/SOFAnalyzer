<p>I just installed Calender indicator.
It's integrated in the top bar of ubuntu and it just shows as a small calender indicator with the date in it. If you click it you can see your google calender which you add on first startup of the program.</p>

<p>I would suggest to try it, it is very small and very handy.</p>

<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/atareao
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install calender-indicator
</code></pre>

<p>Next just run it from the Dash. Enjoy!</p>
