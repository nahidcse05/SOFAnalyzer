<p>You don't need to learn C++ to write apps for Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Ubuntu apps are based on the Ubuntu SDK, with which you'll be programming in QML and JavaScript for some of the logic. There is the possibility to use C++ if your application does any operations that require maximum performance (e.g. advanced image processing), but for most apps QML should be enough.</p>
