  <p>You’ll need to get your Windows 7 or Windows Vista retail disc or
  download the free recovery media from NeoSmart.net</p>
  
  <p>Note: If you don’t have a retail disc with your computer, and instead
  you had to make a recovery media with your PC, don’t worry – you can
  download a Windows 7/Vista recovery disc that allows you to do the
  same thing with a retail disc – except reinstall Windows of course:
  see <a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/" rel="nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/</a> for
  Windows 7 and
  <a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" rel="nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a>
  for Windows Vista. It’s in ISO format that you can easily burn to a
  disc.</p>
  
  <p>Put the disc in, then as it comes up to the installation section (for
  retail discs), click “Repair my computer” then go and select your
  Windows installation, and from there select Command Prompt. For the
  recovery media discs you downloaded from NeoSmart – we’re not sure
  what the steps are, but it’s probably similar.</p>
  
  <p>Then you need to type:</p>
  
  <p>Note: execute one command at a time</p>
  
  <p>bootrec.exe /FixBoot</p>
  
  <p>bootrec.exe /FixMbr</p>
  
  <p>It takes less than a second. Reboot and it’ll boot into Windows
  automatically. Then go to Start menu, right click Computer and select
  Manage. Go to Disk Management from here, and delete the partitions
  related to Ubuntu. Once you’ve done this, extend the volume size of
  your Windows partition to take the remaining free space. To
  delete/extend volume size of a partition, you right click.</p>
