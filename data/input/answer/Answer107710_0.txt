<p>I'd start by visiting the <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/49685/dual-booting-xp-and-windows-7">Windows Stack Exchange site</a> for the <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/460358/dual-booting-with-xp-and-7">setup of XP and Seven</a>. Once those work OK, then install Ubuntu 12.04, which will prompt you for the kind of setup you want; instructions for that are at <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu</a> and here in <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/107538/how-do-i-set-up-a-dual-boot-windows-and-ubuntu">AskUbuntu</a>. They key is to get Windows set up first.</p>
