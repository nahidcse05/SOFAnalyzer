<p>I have a 4830t and the screen looked awful.  I had to manual adjust the <code>rgb</code> gamma and the contrast.  Now it looks a lot better.</p>

<p>I create a simple script to adjust it at boot</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
xgamma -rgamma .8  
xgamma -bgamma .6  
xgamma -ggamma .7  
xcalib -contrast .88  

exit 0
</code></pre>

<p>You can adjust the color and contrast to fit your taste.</p>

<p>I hope this helps</p>
