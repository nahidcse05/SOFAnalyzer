<p>I think it's better to have the OS on the SSD and the /home partition on the storage drive. In this way the OS will load faster, and all your "storage files" like documents, downloaded files etc will be stored on the HDD. I also suggest you to use the SSD for the project files of KDEnlive and (you said light gaming, so I assume you're going to install steam) make a Steam Library on the SSD so these files, kdenlive project and games, will load faster.</p>

<p>About the video card, (ATI/AMD 7870), for the driver you can use either opensource radeon driver (used and installed by default) or fglrx (AMD Catalyst). If you want to install the proprietary fglrx driver you don't have to compiler any .zip/tar file, and you can follow this guide: <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI" rel="nofollow">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI</a></p>
