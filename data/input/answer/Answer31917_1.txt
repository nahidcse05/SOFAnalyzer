<p>I had exact same problem on my Inspiron N5110 running Ubuntu 12.04 but was able to fix it using patch and instructions provided in these two links.</p>

<p>Touchpad is now recognised as a AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint TouchPad and Touchpad tab is enabled in System Settings. Unfortunately, scrolling is still not an option... :-(</p>

<p>At least touchpad is disabled while typing, which was the biggest problem for me resulting in cryptic writings! :-)</p>

<p>[EDIT]: Also Fn+F3 is working now (aka, touchpad toggle).</p>
