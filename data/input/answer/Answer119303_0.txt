  <p>Well, this took a long time. For future searchers, here's what you can do:</p>
  
  <p>Find your contacts2.db file hidden somewhere in Android. Most of the time it's located in /data/data/com.android.providers.contacts/databases. I was lucky and found it in a search through Titanium Backups' tarballs. Nab that file. It has everything in it in a sql database.</p>
  
  <p>I then found this excellent script to extract and convert all contacts into a .vcf format for easy importing into the next device. It's located <a href="https://github.com/stachre/dump-contacts2db" rel="nofollow">here</a> on Github and requires two dependencies (on an Ubuntu 12.04 machine in which it was written for): sqllite3 and libsqllite3-dev:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
</code></pre>
  
  <p>After dependencies are satisfied, save the script on Github as dbconverter.sh. Mark it as executable:</p>

<pre><code>chmod +x dbconverter.sh
</code></pre>
  
  <p>use the script like this:</p>

<pre><code>./dbconverter.sh contacts2.db &gt; contacts2.vcf
</code></pre>
  
  <p>You will then have a lovely .vcf file for easy importing into your phone.</p>
