<p>I solved my own problem. I initially recalled (assumed.  sigh) that I had specified the <em>IP</em> when issuing the 'curl' command from within the container, but in fact I had specified the hostname.  Once I noticed that I had in fact specified the hostname, and that the hostanme resolved to the loopback, i figured out my problem.</p>

<p>In my apache httpd.conf, the Listen di, which I hadn't notice resolved to the loopback device and not the IP on the lxcbr0 bridge. rective specified the hostname.  The httpd.conf file was auto-generated by a vendor tool so I didn't think about it at first.  Once I changed the Listen directive to listen on the correct IP (10.0.3.49) everything worked.</p>
