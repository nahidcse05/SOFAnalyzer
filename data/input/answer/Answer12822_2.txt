<p>A workaround would be to change the old password to a random one, and change it again to a similar one. The password history is not preserved, so this should work fine.</p>

<p>If you need a real solution, please include the contents of your <code>/etc/pam.d/common-password</code> and <code>/etc/pam.d/chpasswd</code> (preferably using a pastebin).</p>
