<p>I haven't tried it myself but there is a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-nexus7/+bug/1072661" rel="nofollow">bug filed</a> where someone else reports the same behavior.  If you have the same behavior please add any details to that bug.  I know that the HTML5 player in youtube works, but it can be sluggish.  Following that bug will be the quickest way to find out when it's fixed.</p>
