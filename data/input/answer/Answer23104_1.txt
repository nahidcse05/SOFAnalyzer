<p>I use ubuntu 11.10 in a tablet and I had the same problem with the scrollbar. I don't have a perfect solution, because it depends on the theme (If you're not sure what theme are you usnig install ubuntu tweak to serch it; mine is Ambiance) and the programs that you're using, but I follow those steps and it's OK for me now:</p>

<p>1- Remove overlay-scrollbars (for unity)</p>

<p>2- Edit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and increase those values</p>

<pre><code>GtkScrollbar::slider-width
GtkScrollbar::min-slider-length
</code></pre>

<p>3- Edit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-widgets and increase </p>

<pre><code>GtkScrollbar-min-slider-length 
GtkRange-slider-width (there are several items, look for the one inside .scrollbar)
</code></pre>

<p>I've increase length to 51 and width to 23 and I'm happy with those values in my tablet (11.6" - 1366x768 pixels). You need to modify both files because gtk2.0 controls for example firefox and thunderbird, and gtk-3.0 controls for example nautilus and gedit. There are lots of tweaks that you can make in both files, I've added</p>

<p>GtkScrollbar::has-backward-stepper = 0
GtkScrollbar::has-forward-stepper = 0</p>

<p>to /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc to remove the ugly arrows in firefox and thunderbird.</p>

<p>You can see some pictures, all of them with my minimum scrollbar width and length:</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
