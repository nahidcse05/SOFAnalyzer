<p>At the moment there is not solution for this issue, its not a theme related setting that can be changed easily.</p>

<p>If you feel this is greatly affecting you, you may report a bug and suggest the change or the lack of that kind of settings <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/" rel="nofollow">directly to the gnome developers</a>.</p>

<p>Has an option you can try to use another file manager that has the navigation buttons on the left side, I recommend you <code>marlin</code> the ElementaryOS file manager.</p>

<p>You can install it by adding the <code>marlin</code> official PPA</p>

<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:marlin-devs/marlin-daily/daily &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>Install <code>marlin</code> using this command</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install marlin
</code></pre>

<p>After that launch in your dash or by pressing AltF2 and typing <code>marlin</code>.</p>

<p>Be aware that <code>marlin</code> is still under development and should be used with some caution.</p>
