<p>I submitted a support request to the developer, and I received the following clarification by email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi,</p>
  
  <p>It's expected behaviour. We're currently working on mobile apps and
  the todo.txt was just a thing so you can view it on your phone. Sorry
  about that.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks, Jono</p>
