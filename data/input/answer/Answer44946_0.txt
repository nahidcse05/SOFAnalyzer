<p>There is no way to undo the partition changes to Windows. You will have to reinstall or recover Windows, then reinstall Ubuntu.</p>

<p>First, try running Boot-Repair(<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair" rel="nofollow">info</a>) and see if this helps. To run this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Boot from a Ubuntu live CD or USB.</p></li>
<li><p>Type these lines in the terminal one line at a time.</p>

<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install boot-repair
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Search for Boot-Repair in the Dash and launch it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To fix your computer with Boot-repair, simply click the "Recommended Repair" button. If it worked, you are done.</p>

<hr>

<p>If Boot Repair didn't work, run a repair with a Windows Recovery CD (ask for one from your PC manufacturer).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Boot from a recovery CD.  You should see this.

<li><p>Close the Window and choose "Startup Repair" this time.  Wait until the process is completed.  It usually takes about 30 minutes-2 hours.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If Windows is successfully repaired, you are done.  If it is not, you will have to reinstall Windows with a Windows Installation CD.</p>

<hr>

<p>Next, after Windows is installed or recovered, you will have to delete the Ubuntu partitions.  Identify them and delete it with the Disk management Utility in Windows.</p>

<p>After that, reinstall Ubuntu the same way.</p>
