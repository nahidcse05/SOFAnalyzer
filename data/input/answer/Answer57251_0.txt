<p>Sir I do not know much about Ubuntu and I want to suggest that try to install different graphic managers like lightgm or gdm. Ff it works then it will be fine.
My ubuntu was stuck on the login screen, so I install them and by opening the virtual terminal <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> I have got the Ubuntu in the working position.</p>
