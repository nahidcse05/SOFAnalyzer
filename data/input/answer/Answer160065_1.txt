<p>It shouldn't be a problem;</p>

<p>Start by shrinking D: from Windows, with disk checks &amp; backups.. Then in gparted, move sda5 to the end (it probably won't be after the shrinking, then shift swap along to meet it, and enlarge sda6 to fill the gap. The partition numbers are however out of order; are you sure that's the order they're actually in? There will be an option to renumber them.</p>
