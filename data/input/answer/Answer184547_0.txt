<p>By design, PlayOnLinux creates a unique Wine prefix for each app installed through it, because of the fact that some programs require certain things to be installed and others not be installed, so the programs could create conflicts with each other. As a result, each of these Wine prefixes has its own config files. You would have to manually go into each prefix and change the theme for each prefix individually.</p>
