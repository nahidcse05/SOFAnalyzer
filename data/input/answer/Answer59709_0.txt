<p>Since I am searching on a similar issue, I am going to ask the basic question...  Did you start Nautilus as root?</p>

<p>From a Terminal Window:</p>

<pre><code>gksudo nautilus &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>I am running 12.10 and the options are all grey'd out unless you have permission to change them.  Wondering if that might be a difference.  Most likely not, but it was worth a shot :)</p>
