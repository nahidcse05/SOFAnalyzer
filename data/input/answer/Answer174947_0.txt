<p>Okay so after some more digging and lot's of experimentation it turns out I have to in fact lower the MTU of wlan0, rather than increase it. The reason, as far as I understood and please correct if I'm wrong, is that probably one of routers or a switch on the way is having a lower MTU as well, thus although it sends the packets correctly, my guess is that the VPN server sees only the MTU from the VPN packets, and replies with that MTU. When they hit this router it just gives up, because the incoming packet is too big. Again that is my hypothesis on the issue. How much to lower it, I can not say exactly. I did first 1412, than 1400 and 1200 in the end it was most stable at 1000 so I stick with that. If it happens to you just experiment a bit with it.</p>
