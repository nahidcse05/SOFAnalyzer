<p>Which keychain do you mean?</p>

<ul>
<li>There's the apt keyring, that is used for verifying downloaded packages. This helps to prevent malicious software from being installed via apt.</li>
<li>There's your user keyring where good apps store passwords (such as mail passwords, wifi passwords)</li>
</ul>

<p>And then there's <a href="http://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=644">this</a>. Guess what that is good for :)</p>
