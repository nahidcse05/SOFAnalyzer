<p>Until about April 2017, yes: <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases</a>. <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS" rel="nofollow"><strong>LTS</strong></a> releases are supported for 5 years. However, the longer you stick with Ubuntu 12.04, the harder it will be to migrate. Things may have changed drastically in 5 years (just compare 8.04 and 12.04). I recommend that you upgrade next year, when 15.04 is out. A year's time should be enough for you to check on compatibility, and barring proprietary drivers and associated problems, 14.04 will run on most about anything that can run 12.04.</p>
