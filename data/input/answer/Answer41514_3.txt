<p>I know this is an old thread, but I found a fix, at least on my system. I was having the same issue, on Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit with dual monitors, even after I turned one of them off. I went into /opt/swordandsworcery/run.sh and uncommented the SDL line. That got me to the segfault issue. Then I went into ~/.capy/SwordAndSworcery/config.txt and found that the width was set to 3840, which is double my single-monitor resolution (or the total resolution when both monitors are on). Switched that to 1920 and everything loaded fine after that.</p>
