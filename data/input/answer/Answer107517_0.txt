<p>Were you shutting down or hibernating? Hibernating is now turned off as default as it does not work with all hardware. <a href="http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/10/enable-hibernation-ubuntu-13-10/" rel="nofollow">Look at enabling hibernation on 13.10</a>. Also if audacious is being closed by shutdown it may not be closing properly so won't save settings. Have you tried closing it normally then opening it to see if settings are saved?</p>
