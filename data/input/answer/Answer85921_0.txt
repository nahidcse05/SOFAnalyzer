<p>The HDMI output is managed by the graphics driver, which in your case is the closed-source driver from Nvidia.
Apparently, that driver enables the HDMI audio encoder only when X is running.</p>

<p>Complain to Nvidia.</p>

<p>Alternatively, use your motherboard's S/PDIF output.</p>

<p><em>Addendum by asker, Magnus Hoff:</em></p>

<p>Pursuing this angle further, I ended up running X but disabling dpms, so the HDMI output is maintained at its powered, fully functional state. I realized I had to do this from reading <a href="ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/gpu-hdmi-audio-document/gpu-hdmi-audio.html#_driver_architecture" rel="nofollow">documentation by nvidia</a>.</p>

<p>To make this happen, I added the following to my <code>.xinitrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>xset s off
xset -dpms
</code></pre>
