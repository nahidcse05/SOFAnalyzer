<p>I have a lot of performance issues with SSDs too. I know about trim, partition alignment, firmware and so on.  I have really poor performance with sandforce based controllers especially. On drives that have are slow, one solution works universally: use the JFS filesystem.</p>

<p>Unfortunately on Debian-based systems, the shutdown process most always results in an unclean shutdown. This occurs frequently with upstart and <em>always</em> using systemd. However, if you don't mind running the risk of a corrupted filesystem, JFS always fixes it. You will find that these SSDs always work great in Windows, too.  I just bought a Phison S10 based SSD after hearing good things about that controller. Well, same issue.  Reinstall using JFS, works great. My Samsung EVO 850, great on all filesystems.</p>
