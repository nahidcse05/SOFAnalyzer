<p>Well,</p>

<p>After looking at <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1923375" rel="nofollow">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1923375</a> and <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1923375" rel="nofollow">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1923375</a>, I found the solution to my problem:</p>

<h2>1: changed the parameter below in bold (it was 'false')</h2>

<pre><code>vi /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono
dns=dnsmasq

[ifupdown]
managed=**true**
</code></pre>

<h2>2: removed the parts in bold below:</h2>

<pre><code>vi /etc/network/interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback 
**iface br0 inet dhcp
   bridge_ports eth0 wlan0
   bridge_stp on
   bridge_fd 0**
</code></pre>

<p>In the end, I don't know what caused this parameters to be like that.
But last week I was playing with KVM network parameters (trying to create a bridge connection), so perhaps it messed it all up...</p>

<p>Anyway, hope this post helps someone else to avoid spending one day on it like me.</p>
