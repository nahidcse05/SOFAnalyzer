<p>Oh, I didn't really miss <code>#!/bin/bash</code> line, just forgot to copy it here, sorry...
I changed the path to the full one(looking at the server's files structure) and it still doesn't work :/ But... when I work on files which are on the server should I call 'em like through http/... or like a local path..? I also got rid of the {} in variables callings. </p>
