<p>Upgrading to 14.04 seemed to be the solution. This machine has been used extensively and been left logged in for 6 days in a row now, and still runs as responsively and smoothly as a freshly rebooted machine / relogged user. Nothing has changed about my hardware. What I have noticed is that gnome-screensaver wasnt set as the default screen saving action for unity in 14.04. Something appears to have changed in regards to how this system manages memory while the screen is locked. No more apparent memory leak.</p>

<p>Something between lightdm, gmome-screensaver, Xorg, compiz, and unity has been updated enough between 12.* and 14.04 that this issue I was experiencing has been relieved. I also think not having a dedicated graphics card and having a less-than-adequate motherboard were involved in creating the right environmental conditions to cause this problem. My home machine, with a nice graphic card and far faster motherboard, has never exhibited this issue, even with the same exact software-level setup.</p>
