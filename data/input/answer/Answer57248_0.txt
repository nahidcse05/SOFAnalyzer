<p>This is on the TeamViewer site.</p>

<p>Notes to Multiarch:
On newer 64-bit DEB-systems with Multiarch-support (Debian 7) teamviewer_linux_x64.deb cannot be installed because the package ia32-libs is not available anymore on these systems. In this case you can use teamviewer_linux.deb instead.</p>

<p>In case you get the error “<strong>wrong architecture i386</strong>” you have to execute the following command lines:</p>

<pre><code>dpkg --add-architecture i386

apt-get update
</code></pre>
