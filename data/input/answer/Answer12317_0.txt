<p>Assuming this happens always when you are either on AC power or on battery:</p>

<p>Hit the  key and start typing <code>power management</code> (<code>po</code> is probably enough) and when you see it comming up in the results hit enter.</p>

<p>You will see 3 tabs. 2 of them are important for your question:</p>

<ol>
<li>One for when on AC power:</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>and one for when on battery power:</li>
</ol>

<p>Both have an action set here for "When laptop lid is closed" (hence ændrük's comment).</p>

<p>If both are not set to 'suspend' you have your answer: change it to 'suspend'.</p>

<p>If this is not the issue you probably found a bug. I have seen some bugs related to suspend and several netbooks (including yours) but these are old. Have a look in your log files and see if it shows any errors when suspend does not work.</p>

<p>Same way as looking at <code>power management</code>: hit the  key and start typing <code>log file viewer</code>. When it shows up scroll down to <code>pm-suspend.log</code> and check this file for errors.</p>

<p>You are looking for lines like these but then with errors:</p>

<pre>/usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/00powersave resume suspend: success.
Running hook /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/00logging resume suspend:

/usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/00logging resume suspend: success.

/usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/000kernel-change resume suspend: success.

<p>If there are any please add these to your question.</p>
