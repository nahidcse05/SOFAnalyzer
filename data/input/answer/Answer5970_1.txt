<p>Thanks luri for the help but I figured it out </p>

<p>What I did is this: </p>

<p>Downloaded the nvidia driver from their website </p>

<p>reboot -> recovery mode -> root command line level -> uninstall all nvidia drivers -> get down to level 3 "telinit 3" -> stop gdm "service gdm stop" -> delete xorg.conf file -> install nvidia that I downloaded </p>

<p>Everything is now perfect </p>
