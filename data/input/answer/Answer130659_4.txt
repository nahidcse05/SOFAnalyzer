<p>For the most part sluggishness in a netbook (even with an SSD) comes down to one of the following.</p>

<ul>
<li>An older SATA controller (v1 or v2), since a SSD can usually flood this channel, you'll generally only get about 2x the i/o over an HDD.</li>
<li>A <em>really</em> slow or otherwise limited CPU, usually the memory controllers, on-chip cache and other features are reduced compared to full featured counterparts.</li>
<li>A bloated OS install</li>
<li>Limited RAM</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that you're running a light OS (Xubuntu) and you do have a SATA 3 controller, and have plenty of RAM I would suggest testing the drive in another system to be certain.</p>
