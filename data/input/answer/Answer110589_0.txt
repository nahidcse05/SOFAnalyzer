<p>Finally I found it. This is indicated as a <strong>licence problem</strong>.</p>

<p>The reason is that I installed Licensed <code>mpd</code> (not free <code>mpd</code>) in my virtual machine.
Then I copy the virtual machine to another computer.
ThatÂ´s why the <code>mpd</code> can not be used in the new machine. I should update the licence.</p>

<p>Thank you for the concern.</p>
