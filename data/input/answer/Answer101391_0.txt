<p>This happens to me from time to time and it's because my secondary monitor is bigger than the main one. Rhythmbox seems to preffer wide spaces...
My solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unmaximize rhythmbox.</li>
<li>Move it to the primary monitor.</li>
<li>Resize the window until it's smaller than the monitor size.</li>
<li>Pres the maximize button (or drag rhythmbox to the top bar so it maximizes.</li>
</ol>
