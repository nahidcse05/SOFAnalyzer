<p>Along with the rest of answers - have you checked your <code>.bashrc</code> file to make sure that JAVA_HOME environment is not there?  Removing that line should do the trick in freeing your Ubuntu from openjdk.  Like an example:</p>

<pre><code> JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0_45
 export PATH=$JAVA_HOME:$PATH
</code></pre>

<p>If you see anything like that, then delete these two lines and reboot.</p>
