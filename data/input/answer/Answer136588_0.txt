<p>When accidentally disabling the only attached display, trying to reenable it from another virtual console will yield in the following error message:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>xrandr: Configure crtc 0 failed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please make sure the actual virtual console where X Windows is running is active, when xrandr is actuating the configuration. Typing the following in the first virtual console rescued me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudo chvt 7; sleep 3; xrandr --display :0.0 --auto</p>
</blockquote>
