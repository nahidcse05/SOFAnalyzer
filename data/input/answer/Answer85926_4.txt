<p>A book is a huge writing project.  The chief problem is with the organization of potentially hundreds of pages of manuscript during the initial drafting stage.   That can be tackled by creating numerous documents for each project, for example one per chapter.  <strong>LIBRE OFFICE</strong> would handle that approach well.  </p>

<p>Some writers have issues with creating numerous files for each project because it makes it far more difficult to move text around among the various chapters as they draft the book.  For instance, if they are looking for something specific that they drafted a while back and try to search by keyword, then they may have to resort to search through many chapters individually until they score.  </p>

<p>With a single file project, Libre Office is very difficult to draft a book.  You have to scroll what might seem like forever before finally reaching the desired portion.  There isn't an easy to use Table of Contents for the file that organizes one file into units available at a click.  With Libre Office you will inevitable end up scrolling much more of your writing time away compared to other tools that automatically navigate around a file to specific sections, like a table of contents.</p>

<p><strong>ZIM WIKI DESKTOP</strong> is an excellent way to draft a book length manuscript, quickly organizing the raw text into sections.  The output can be exported into numerous formats including HTML, and of course WIKI format, its primary design purpose.  </p>

<p>Prior to the drafting stage, <strong>TOMBOY NOTES</strong> makes an excellent way of sketching the book and writing preliminary chapters in text format.  The user creates notes, i.e. chapters, ideas, or anything that typed up. The advantage with it is that it excels above other applications in it's ability to search and retrieve keywords from among all its notes, or a selected portion of notes that fall under a user created notebook.  Tomboy Notes can be imported into ZIM WIKI DESKTOP or exported to HTML, or TEXT.</p>

<p>Both ZIM WIKI and TOMBOY NOTES are fairly distraction free compared to heavy weight applications like Libre Office. </p>

<p><strong>FocusWriter</strong> is designed specifically to eliminate distractions.  The application can takes up the entire screen and has a foreground (page) and background (frame around the page).  A menu pops up at the top of the screen when moused over.  When mousing over the bottom of the screen the writing goals pop up, such as the percentage of words per day completed.  A timer can be set also.  When mousing over the left edge of the screen a table of scenes list pops up, to easily navigate from among those defined, making navigation around a lengthy document possible. There is also spell check, as is the case with all the other programs I've mentioned in this post.</p>

<p>Another handy tool is <strong>ARTHA</strong>  It's a powerful thesaurus and dictionary that automatically pops up on any word highlighted on any of the programs mentioned.  The user simply presses ctrl-alt-W or the tool gives definitions, alternatives, relatives, and antonyms to the highlighted word.  The user can also redefine the ctrl-key activator to anything that suits their taste.</p>

<p>After the manuscript for the book is drafted, it has to be formatted for printing.  </p>

<p>Publishers frequently require submittal in RTF or DOC format, then they use this to generate their own proprietary format that they print to paper on.  The specified DOC or RTF formats have to be rigorously adhered to else the publishers will reject them outright.  Still, It's worth reiterating that this is just a preliminary format, not the format the book itself will be printed to paper directly from.</p>

<p>If you are self publishing, then ebook formats are a frequent focus.  HTML is the best format to export to because it can easily be converted to popular ebook formats such as epub and mobi, by a third party vendor who offers the service of ebook publication.  Also, the <strong>CALLIBRE</strong> application can easily convert html formats to epub and mobi since  all three are essentially markup language formats, designed for indefinite viewing dimensions.  (Various ebook reader sizes, or monitors)</p>

<p>If you are printing your own books to paper, then <strong>LyX (using LaTeX and TeX)</strong> is a method that's popular, at least in the academic world, and for thesis papers. An alternative to LyX (LaTeX) final formatting and printout directly to paper includes <strong>SCRIBUS</strong> which offers a true What You See is What You Get approach.  All of those final formatting methods will require a significant learning curve to master, but they can offer special advantages.  For example, a master of LaTeX can craft a book in simple text, than automatically have LyX mark it up for Fancy Book output, and do this all with minimal fuss, letting the program handle all the formatting specifics and keeping it out of sight, out of mind to the author.  The author essentially hits the export to pdf button and the markup is converted to a book with perfect proportions, fonts and layout. That is a markup approach.  </p>

<p>Another approach, especially for graphics intensive books, is <strong>SCRIBUS</strong> 
A master of Scribus can craft unique books with lots of graphics, and do this artistically as she sees fit, seeing the exact final output on screen as they edit, and do this more effectively than with a traditional word processor like Libre Office, or a non traditional markup "document" processor like LyX.</p>

<p>The key is taking the time, LOTS of time, to learn those tools.  <strong>Libre Office</strong> can also format a final draft of a book for final print to paper.  Its easy to start, but still takes quite some time to discover all its capibilites.  Prepare to also have learning time with this application.  Hopefully you've got a first draft done else the learning phase could be a major distraction from the creative writing process.   Still, the hurdle of success is stepped much lower with Libre Office than with LyX or Scribus.  Prepare time for any of these, though, to vent from software frustrations as you learn.  </p>

<p>Lastly, <strong>Calligra Suit and Calligra Author</strong> is in fast paced development (not to be confused with Callibre, which easily manages ebook collects and can convert html into ebooks).  Calliagra Suit aims to be the KDE destop alternative to the ever popular Libre Office.  In addition to Calligra Words, it offers an additional tool called Calligra Author that focuses on distraction free writing, organizing and easy ebook creation directly into the ebook champion formats of epub and mobi.  After 2014, its expected that development will reach fruition. Perhaps then <strong>Kubuntu Linux</strong> will offer Calligra Suit as the default installation for word processing and spreadsheets. I've just started using Kubuntu 13.10 and can tout that their <strong>KDE Desktop</strong> pleases me very well.  And, Calligra Suit is starting to shape up as a contender to Libre Office in Word Processing.  Calligra Author might soon become valuable after their planned features are implemented. </p>
