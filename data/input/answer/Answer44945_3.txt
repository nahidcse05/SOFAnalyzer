<p>Have you tried to install the WINE Launchpad PPA yet? This is different from the Software Center. Updates to WINE are delivered via their PPA.</p>

<p>After doing that, try installing again.</p>

<p>And be sure to NOT be installing or removing any other packages during the install. Applications have to get a "lock" to prevent other packages from installing/uninstalling when it is trying to install/uninstall.</p>
