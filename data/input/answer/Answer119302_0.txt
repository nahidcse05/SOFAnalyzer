<p><del>There is a skip option if you don't want to donate.</del>  </p>

<p>Apparently the skip button is not showing on the Wubi download page, possibly a bug as other download pages have the skip option.</p>

<p>You can download it from <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/" rel="nofollow">the 12.04 page</a></p>

<p>However, please remember: </p>

<ul>
<li>WUBI was dropped after 12.10, so no support will be available.</li>
<li>WUBI doesn't support UEFI / win 8.</li>
</ul>
