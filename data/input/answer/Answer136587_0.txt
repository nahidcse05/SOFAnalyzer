<p>I just attempted to install Winusb on 14.04 using the directions at <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/489546/installing-winusb-on-ubuntu-14-04">Installing WinUSB on Ubuntu 14.04</a> and it didn't happen (with the terminal citing dependency issues).  Plus I've noticed that there are some Ubuntu themes that work okay on 12.04 but not on 14.04.</p>

<p>Having tried 12.04, 12.10, 13.04, 13.10, and 14.04 on bare metal (and 14.10 and 15.04 on live usb), I'm reinstalling 12.04. </p>
