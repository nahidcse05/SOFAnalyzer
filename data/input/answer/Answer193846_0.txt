<p>It sounds like you just copied the ISO to the USB drive. That isn't how it works. You need to actually "burn" the ISO, which essentially extracts it and copies the contents to the USB stick. I would recommend using <a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie" rel="nofollow">Rufus</a> to burn the ISO. It's a quick and easy-to-use program. There's also a portable version, so no need for an installation.</p>
