<p>Here's a simple variation using a bash script that inserts an empty line at the beginning of every file in a directory passed as an argument that must exist.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# requires one argument that is path to a directory whose files you want
# to add an initial line to

for f in $(ls $1)
do
    mv $1/$f $1/$f.orig
    echo -e "\t" &gt; $1/$f
    cat $1/$f.orig &gt;&gt; $1/$f
    rm $1/$f.orig
done
</code></pre>
