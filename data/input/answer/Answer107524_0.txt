<p>To play a DVD use this script I put together for my daughter (it prevents multiple launches).</p>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code># RunOneVLC.sh

# NOTE: to skip the Run in Terminal | Display | Cancel | Run dialog box:
#     In Nautilus, choose Edit - Preferences - Behavior - Execute Text Files : Run executable text files when they are opened.

LOCKFILE=/tmp/vlclock.txt
# see if the lockfile already exists / the process is already running
if [ -e ${LOCKFILE} ] &amp;&amp; kill -0 `cat ${LOCKFILE}`; then
    echo "already running"
    exit
fi

# make sure the lockfile is removed when we exit and then claim it
trap "rm -f ${LOCKFILE}; exit" INT TERM EXIT
# echo the pid into the lockfile (creating it)
echo $$ &gt; ${LOCKFILE}

# do stuff
vlc dvdsimple://dev/dvd -f

# remove the lockfile
rm -f ${LOCKFILE}

<h1>wireless</h1>

<p>I'm not positive on the wireless driver, and the wrapping got funny in your pasted text, but here's the significant part.</p>

<p><i>udf Universal Disk Format Filesystem zram Compressed RAM Block Device arc4 ARC4 Cipher Algorithm w35und</i> <b>IS89C35 802.11bg WLAN USB Driver</b> <i>nouveau nVidia Riva/TNT/GeForce/Quadro/Tesla mac80211 IEEE 802.11 subsystem snd_via82xx VIA VT82xx audio</i></p>

<p>Ignore the italics (they show surrounding text), the bold is important.
I'm not sure if the w35und is attached to the wifi or surrounding.
IS89C35 is the wifi chip you'll want to search for, such as "IS89C35 wireless lubuntu 13.10".</p>

<p>See if this command shows you anything.  It helped on an old Dell.  A Hard Block is like when you have a wifi disable switch on a laptop.  Soft Block is some software blocking or configuration issue.</p>

<pre><code>rfkill list all
</code></pre>

<p>If I remember right this tries to clear Soft Blocks.</p>

<pre><code>rfkill unblock all
</code></pre>
