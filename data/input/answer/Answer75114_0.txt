<p>Does gparted list the device?
If so and recovering the data is unimportant to you, or you fail doing so, you can format the drive to a suitable standard. For Unixoid systems as e.g. android this could be ext2/3 or a a universal standard NTFS or FAT 32. In the last case you should select yout format depending on the data you plan to save on the sd-card: 
In case you don't intend to save files bigger than 4GB or the sd-card by itslef is limited to a memory of under 4GB you can select the simple FAT32, otherwise you should select NTFS. Ubuntu can handle both formats while windows will not recognize ext-filesystems.</p>
