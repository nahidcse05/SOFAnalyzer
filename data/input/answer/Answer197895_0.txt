<p>As <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/694365/found-ls-binary-using-whereis-but-cant-find-ll-why/694530#comment1014978_694366">noted by kos</a> in the comments, you should use the <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/type.html">bash built-in <code>type</code> command</a> which, unlike <code>whereis</code>, is also aware of aliases and shell built-ins:</p>

<pre><code>$ type ll ls cd
ll is aliased to `ls -alF'
ls is hashed (/bin/ls)
cd is a shell builtin
</code></pre>

<p>(For the meaning of "hashed", see <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/105876/what-does-rm-is-hashed-mean">this question on unix.SE</a>.)</p>
