<p>I used</p>

<pre><code>dpkg --remove --force-remove sun-java6-bin
</code></pre>

<p>The problem was caused by an incomplete installation of JDK6</p>

<p>For anyone having this problem, I recommend installing Synaptic Package Manager after fixing this to avoid any problems like this in the future.</p>
