<p>There are a couple of ways to accomplish this. One is to mount the remote directory. This can be done via samba shares (if the remote host is running windows this is quite simple). If the remote host is running Linux then you could either mount the remote directory using sshfs or simply connect to it with an FTP client such as filezilla (filezilla can be set to connect over ssh which is often simpler) and download the entire directory that way.</p>
