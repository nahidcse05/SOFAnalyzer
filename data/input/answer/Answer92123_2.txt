<p>I notice you said you wanted to use Oracle's JDK. If you want to install Oracle's JDK instead, you can download that and extract it in the location of your choice.</p>

<p>Then you just use update-alternatives to tell your system where Java is installed. If you're not sure about the syntax of update-alternatives, you can use the front-end for it, galternatives.</p>

<p>For example... I use Oracle's JDK quite extensively here.</p>

<p>I extract it to /opt/java/.</p>

<p>Then, so all of Oracle Java's binaries are the primary utilities for Java-related stuff, I do the following with update-alternatives:</p>

<pre><code>for j in `ls /opt/java/bin` ; do update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/"$j" "$j" /opt/java/bin/"$j" 1 ; done
</code></pre>

<p>This takes all of the Oracle Java utilities that you've previously extracted, and 
gives them the first priority, in case you have other versions of Java installed. (since Ubuntu allows you to have multiple versions of the same utility installed)</p>
