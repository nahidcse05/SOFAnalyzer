<p>Not all of these libraries are necessary to use the plugins supported by Pipelight. You can find a list of really essential libraries at <a href="http://pipelight.net/cms/faqs/faq-libraries-missing.html">http://pipelight.net/cms/faqs/faq-libraries-missing.html</a></p>

<p>Some libraries are only required for very specific use cases like libnetapi.so which makes it possible for Wine to interact with Windows servers and Windows network shares. This is not used by any of the supported plugins and you do not need to care about it. There was also a bug report at <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/pipelight/+bug/1327518">https://bugs.launchpad.net/pipelight/+bug/1327518</a> to fix these remaining libraries and most of them should be fixed in the next release (except libnetapi.so which is not multiarch ready on Ubuntu yet).</p>
