<p>when i dual boot i usually do this in windows before i install ubuntu:  make a 2048 mb partiton for swap, make a 100 gb partition for the ubuntu install.    stop where you are and do that first or else you will screw up the boot loader and you will BRICK  the computer.  then when you go thru the install choose "something else".  make the 2048 your swap and make the 100 your install partition.  good luck...</p>
