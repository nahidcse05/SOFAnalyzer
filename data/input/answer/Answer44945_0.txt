<p>I was running Wine 1.5.7 perfectly well on 12.04 but after an upgrade this morning I started getting the errors you describe. It was the 1.5.7-0ubuntu3-pulse18 versions that were the problem.</p>

<p>(EDIT: Thanks to swift work on the part of the Wine packaging team, you can now upgrade away from the troublesome version. Try that first before attempting the downgrade method below.)</p>

<p>Fortunately I still had the 0ubuntu2 versions in my cache so I could downgrade like so (I'm on 64-bit, so if you're on 32-bit the dpkg line will be different).</p>

<pre><code>cd /var/cache/apt/archives/
sudo dpkg -i wine1.5_1.5.7-0ubuntu2~pulse18_amd64.deb wine1.5-amd64_1.5.7-0ubuntu2~pulse18_amd64.deb wine1.5-i386_1.5.7-0ubuntu2~pulse18_i386.deb
sudo apt-get -f install
</code></pre>

<p>Having done so Wine is working again. If you don't have these packages you can get them here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wine/+archive/ppa/+build/3602432" rel="nofollow">https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wine/+archive/ppa/+build/3602432</a></li>
<li><a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wine/+archive/ppa/+build/3602433" rel="nofollow">https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wine/+archive/ppa/+build/3602433</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In which case, run the dpkg command from where you downloaded them, rather than your apt cache.</p>
