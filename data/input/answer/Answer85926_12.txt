<p>Since no one else has mentioned it: If you want something as predictable as LaTeX, but don't need all of the power (and the complexity that comes with that power), <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is a great language. It's what's this website uses for markup. </p>

<p>You write plain text and it gets converted to formatted text:</p>

<p>Input:</p>

<pre><code># Title

This is a paragraph with *italics* and **bold**.
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<hr>

<h1>Title</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph with <em>italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ubuntu has a program called <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>, which can convert Markdown to basically any format you could want (including LaTeX, if you decide you want fancier formatting than Markdown can do).</p>
