<p>It's a simplicity thing.  If you want to break dependency chains, use custom packages.  It COULD be that when that package is installed, things just work, but there's some weird dependency issue that happens when it's not.  Ubuntu has come a LONG(and I mean astronomically long) way in the last couple of years in sorting out dependency chain issues.  They still rock socks compared to rpm based distros.</p>
