  <p>how does a server actually work? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Workflow for a webserver as an example: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Desktop (Ubuntu desktop installation)</p>

<ul>
<li>Browser

<ul>
<li>URL contains a domain and parameters</li>
<li>Waits till results arrives and shows them</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Computer that has this domain (Ubuntu server installation)</p>

<ul>
<li>Webserver (Apache)

<ul>
<li>Program that gets parameters and executes it. Does what it needs to do (create website, content, show a form etc). Could be in combination with a database (MySQL), a coding language (Python, Perl, Javascript).</li>
<li>Send results to desktop</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it basically an operating system? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ehm. No. Ubuntu is the operating system. What makes it a server is the fact you install server software onto it and set it up. Like hosting a website you do with Apache (= webserver). In combination you can also add or have a database (MySQL; databaseserver) or a mailsystem (=mailserver).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's the difference between running a server with Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None whatsoever. You can remove the "desktop" component and have a "server". You can use a "desktop" to install server software like a webserver, printserver, databaseserver, mailserver, template server and so on and call it a server. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would I go about doing that with server set up</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu has a setup that installs it all and creates a basic setup for you using your desktop machine. <code>sudo apt-get install lampserver^</code> will install the Linux version for Apache, Mysql, Perl and set it up for you such that you can point your browser to <code>http://localhost</code> and it will show a website with "ItWorks!" on it.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If you want this to work remotely you need to purchase a domain, receive an IP adress (and a name for that IP) and then you can use that IP or that name instead of localhost. </li>
</ul>
