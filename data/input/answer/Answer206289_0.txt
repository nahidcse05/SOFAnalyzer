<p>That's a QT file/folder dialog which doesn't show (un)mounted drives in the left column. This happens because the developer(s) of those applications didn't add places and URLs to the dialog sidebar using <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfiledialog.html#setSidebarUrls" rel="nofollow">QFileDialog::setSidebarUrls()</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, you can still access mounted drives:</p>

<ol>
<li>Plug in the HDD and click on it in the file manager to get it mounted.</li>
<li>In that file dialog, navigate to <code>/media/&lt;username&gt;</code> or <code>/mnt</code> folders and you should see the hard drive partitions as folders there. You can browse in them the contents of the drives.</li>
</ol>

<p>You must navigate to the mount point of the partition. There you'll find its contents. You can see mount points in Disks utility (<code>gnome-disks</code>).</p>
