<p>Unfortunately, this is by design.</p>

<p>As per <a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2010/07/25/desktop-in-the-shell/" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a> on the design of gnome shell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL;DR/summary: the desktop metaphor sucks. We are stuck with a limited
  surface, limited file management tools, and a background that actively
  impairs legibility of the files sitting on it (unless youâ€™re using a
  solid black background).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As such, it was removed from gnome shell as far as I can tell.</p>
